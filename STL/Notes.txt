Difference between vectors and List :--

1. vectors :  
    1.vectors are dynamic arrays that resizes itslef automatically when an element is entered or removed from it.
    2.vectors are stored in contiguous memory location.
    3.Elements are inserted at the end of arrays.

2. LIST :
    1. List supports both forward and backward traversal.
    2. it has non contiguous memory.
    3. No preallocated memories.


Differences :

              vector                                                       list
1    It has contiguous memory                               It has non contiguous memory
2    My have default size                                   no default size
3.   elemnts have stoarge for them only                     have storage to store pointer to the next node also
4.   only insetion and deletion at end                      All operation have contant time complexity
     has constant time, elase are expensive
5.   random access of elements are possible                 random access is not possible



The following are the differences between vector and array −

Vector is a sequential container to store elements and not index based.
Array stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type and it is index based.
Vector is dynamic in nature so, size increases with insertion of elements.
As array is fixed size, once initialized can’t be resized.
Vector occupies more memory.
Array is memory efficient data structure.
Vector takes more time in accessing elements.
Array access elements in constant time irrespective of their location as elements are arranged in a contiguous memory allocation.
