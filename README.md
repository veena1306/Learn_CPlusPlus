Operator Overloading :- When an operator is overloaded with multiple Jobs, it is known as operator overloading
                        It is a way to implement compile time polymorphism.


#dynamic casting :- 
A cast is an operator that converts data from one type to another type. In C++, dynamic casting is mainly used for safe downcasting at run time. To work on dynamic_cast there must be one virtual function in the base class. A dynamic_cast works only polymorphic base class because it uses this information to decide safe downcasting.

Downcasting: Casting a base class pointer (or reference) to a derived class pointer (or reference) is known as downcasting. In figure 1  casting from the Base class pointer/reference to the “derived class 1” pointer/reference showing downcasting (Base ->Derived class).

Upcasting: Casting a derived class pointer (or reference) to a base class pointer (or reference) is known as upcasting. In figure 1 Casting from Derived class 2 pointer/reference to the “Base class” pointer/reference showing Upcasting (Derived class 2 -> Base Class)
